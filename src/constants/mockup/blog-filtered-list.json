          "content": "Shipping has taken hard knocks since January 2020. The last five years have not been stellar for ocean carriers as they feel the burden of having smaller rooms of error for losses.\n\nInitially, 2020 was met with optimism in late 2019, with the only concerns being for [IMO 2020 with extra charges](https://www.hellenicshippingnews.com/shippers-hit-with-extra-costs-vessel-issues-amid-imo-2020/) and the cost of installing scrubbers. It has now become more apparent that with the lockdown in China in January, and the subsequent lockdown of Europe and North America, that demand for ocean freight has simply dropped.\n\n### What Does All This Mean for Shipping?\n\nThere is a potential [loss of 10% of shipping volume](https://www.offshore-energy.biz/container-lines-may-lose-17-mn-teu-in-2020-due-to-coronavirus/) due to COVID-19 (roughly a loss of 17 million carrier TEU). In addition, it is estimated that container lines are losing revenue of up to between [$300m to $350m](https://www.seatrade-maritime.com/containers/container-lines-hit-300m-350m-weekly-revenue-loss-coronavirus) as they blank sailings. According to FreightWaves, the worst-case scenario for carriers is a [collective loss of $23b this year](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/container-lines-scramble-to-avert-life-threatening-covid-19-losses).\n\nMoody’s also downgraded the ocean shipping outlook of 2020 from stable to negative with an expected loss of 6-10% of carrier EBITDA. However, despite this, ocean freight has remained more resilient than other types of shipping.\n\n### Ocean Freight Has Remained Resilient During the COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nDespite the negative outlook for the global economy and shipping in 2020, there are still some positives to recognize.\n\nAccording to a [DHL report on COVID-19 on March 10th](https://www.dhl.com/content/dam/dhl/global/dhl-global-forwarding/documents/pdf/glo-dgf-statement-corona-virus.pdf), while airfreight continues to present challenges, ocean freight has remained relatively unaffected with China, Europe, North America, and many other regions still operating as normal with only a few ports being affected.\n\nLikewise, China has already begun the road to recovery. Like post-SARS in 2004, there is an expected boom in demand for shipping, and [economic activity will return](https://investors-corner.bnpparibas-am.com/investment-themes/coronavirus-lessons-from-sars-for-investors/), minus some initial haulage problems.\n\nHowever, until a full recovery is in place, what can shippers do to ensure their cargo gets to where it needs to be?\n\nWell, that’s where BlueX comes in, and we believe that the new way of shipping through digitalization will be the new standard of ocean shipping.",

Here are a few areas you can explore with them:\n\n<u>1) Offer discounts for early payment</u>\n\nHave you considered offering incentives for your clients to pay their invoices earlier? An early payment discount (EPD) can range from 1 to 2%, but a small loss in revenue might be worth getting fast access to cash that can be put towards urgent business needs, such as payroll or rent. Another benefit is that receiving payments early contributes to lower days sales outstanding (DSO) metrics, which can enhance your company’s overall financial health rating.     \n\n<u>2) Negotiating with suppliers on payment due dates</u>\n\nThe payment terms in most industries are generally net 30, which means that payments that are as little as a day late can have a major impact on expenses on a fixed schedule like rent or payroll. However, some supply chain partners may be open to accepting net 15 or net 20 payment terms. \n",

          "content": "There is an undisputed correlation between modernizing AP / AR processes and overall business growth. A [recent PYMNTS report](https://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2022/25-percent-b2b-payments-are-made-by-check/) found that over 50% of US CFOs surveyed say that digitizing their AP / AR operations has allowed for an increase in payment types such as [ACH payments](https://www.bluextrade.com/blog/are-ach-payments-safe-in-2022-advantages-and-disadvantages), credit cards, wires, and real-time payments (RTP), among others. \n\n<u>1) Centralize your payment tools</u>\n\nEfficiency and transparency in AP / AR processes are essential to cash flow management, which is why relying on manual operations can result in wasted resources. All-in-one payment platforms offer a remedy to this scenario by bringing all of these processes – such as expenses, payroll, and revenue management – under one digital dashboard. Over 40% of main street businesses surveyed by [PYMNTS](https://www.pymnts.com/smbs/2023/small-merchants-opt-automation-over-price-hikes-manage-slowing-consumer-demand/) said that implementing an all-in-one payment platform simplified their receivables tracking, and 32% said the technology had led to improvements in working capital.   \n\nBlueX Pay, for example, offers [a payment platform](https://www.bluextrade.com/payer/) that amplifies cash flow for buyers and sellers. Businesses can set up a digital wallet to make and receive payments, as well as access Pay-it-Later services. All of the transactions can be viewed on their dashboard, which enables easy reconciliation. \n\n<u>2) Use digital payments, and encourage your supply chain to do the same</u>\n\nUsing legacy accounting processes such as mailing physical checks may avoid the costs of digital payments, but you should consider the time it takes to process the checks, which can take anywhere from days to weeks. This time loss could translate into a loss in capital which can easily  exceed a digital processing fee. This does not mean that you need to stop using checks for the vendors who prefer this approach, but it would be worthwhile to encourage other businesses in your supply chain to switch to digital payments, as  this could bring benefits to all.  \n\nAnd with the FedNow real-time payment network set to launch in the US later this year, there has never been a more advantageous time for businesses to make the move to digital payments.

          "content": "An uncertain economy and limited access to bank loans are leading small businesses to search for more creative financing methods, such as [inventory financing](https://www.bluextrade.com/blog/Inventory-Financing-the-Pros-and-Cons), invoice factoring, or B2B pay-it-later solutions. Fintech companies are watching the trends and rolling out tools that connect businesses to these finance options, which can provide a lower barrier to entry and more flexible payment terms. \n\n<u>1) Inventory financing</u>\n\nWith inventory financing, businesses can put up the inventory they wish to buy as collateral for the purchase itself, such as in cases where they need additional stock for a busy season. The borrower doesn't need to pay back the lender until after they sell off all the inventory, and if the business defaults on the loan, the lender has the option to then try and sell the remaining stock themselves.  \n\nThe benefits of inventory financing include: no need to stake personal assets such as a house or car; funding is usually fast; and there’s no credit check required. However, this approach usually requires more due diligence on the part of lenders to access the inventory’s liquidation value, which can result in longer wait times for funding. And some lenders may demand a minimum amount of financing that might be too high for smaller businesses to meet. You can consider [BlueX](https://www.bluextrade.com/pay-it-later/) to assist you with inventory financing, as we don't require an assessment on the inventory's liquidation value, nor do we require a minimum amount to get the financing. \n\n<u>2) Invoice Factoring</u> \n\nInvoice factoring, also known as AR factoring, is a finance option in which the business sells its invoices to a third party at a reduced price, which allows the business fast access to working capital without needing to take out a loan. For example, a 90% advance on a $10,000 invoice would provide the business with $9,000 in cash right now, with the difference going to the factoring company upon collection of the invoice from the businesses’ customer. \n\n<u>3) BlueX Pay-it-Later</u>\n\nBlueX offers a third alternative to small businesses that need to enhance their cash flow in the form of our B2B Pay-it-Later solution. BlueX Pay-it-Later offers fast access to up to $1 million for cargo and all your logistics service needs. Businesses can get approved in less than 48 hours, and have up to 60 days to pay back their invoices. There is no application or set up fees, and we pay your vendors on time so you can pay later and focus on the goals that drive business growth.\n\nReach out to the [BlueX team](https://www.bluextrade.com/pay-it-later/) on how to make better payments and amplify your cash flow.\n",

Though there were multiple factors, the main reason was that its investments had greatly decreased in value, leading depositors to withdraw large sums at once.\n- On March 12th, just two days later, **Signature Bank** was closed down after account holders withdrew large sums of money following the collapse of SVB. \n- On May 1st, **First Republic Bank (FRB)** became the second-largest bank collapse in U.S. history when most of its business was sold to JPMorgan Chase after it was seized by federal regulators. The main cause was a cascade effect of runs on deposits produced by the closing of SVB and Signature Bank. \n- According to the New York Times, the three banks [combined held more in inflation-adjusted assets](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/business/bank-failures-svb-first-republic-signature.html) than the 25 U.S. banks that collapsed in the financial crisis of 2008. \n\n![image1.png](/uploads/image1_278db2c02d.png)\nSource: [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/business/bank-failures-svb-first-republic-signature.html) via data from Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

[Close to 50% of banks surveyed](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/banks-tighten-credit-terms-see-loan-demand-drop-fed-survey-shows-2023-05-08/) said that lending standards were slightly more stringent to small businesses compared to January of this year.\n\n1. <u>Another interest rate rise:</u> In late March, The Federal Reserve [decided to raise rates by 0.25%](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65041649) even while the banking collapse was happening. This has also led to higher interest rates on business financing in the short term. ",

          "content": "**Prioritize a healthy balance sheet over growth:** In these times of economic disruption, focusing on the fundamentals of cash flow management and maintaining a healthy balance sheet should sometimes take precedence over business growth. You can consider pausing plans to grow your business and instead look at how to keep capital stable in the long-term beyond just this month or quarter.  \n\n**Digitize your AR:** Moving your legacy AR processes onto a digital platform at this timing is not just helpful, it’s essential. Such platforms are shown to greatly improve invoice reconciliation, reduce days sales outstanding (DSO), and increase overall visibility and efficiency in the payment process. If you’re not able to see all of your payment data in a single window, maintaining long-term visibility over your capital will become increasingly difficult.   \n\n**Inventory financing or A/R factoring:** There are more and more creative ways to finance your business besides credit cards and bank loans. If you are a retail business that struggles to purchase the stock you need for seasonal demands, you can consider inventory financing, which is using the inventory you need to buy as collateral for itself. Or, businesses with credit histories too short to get loans can try accounts receivable (A/R) factoring, or selling your invoices to a third party company for an advance on a portion of the invoice value. You can contact BlueX Sales for more information about our related solutions. \n\n**Use Pay-it-Later to maintain strong cash flow:** Just by giving you more time to pay, B2B Pay-it-Later (PIL) solutions can help to offset rising supply costs and help your business acquire more inventory. B2B PIL is an ideal solution for companies looking to modernize their payment systems, reduce costs, and improve their competitive advantage.\n\nFor example, [BlueX Pay-it-Later](https://www.bluextrade.com/pay-it-later/) offers pay-later options for your cargo and all your logistics invoices, providing financing options with up to 100% of net invoice value and up to 1 million in funds available in 48 hours. BlueX will pay your vendor on time, and you can choose between net 30/60-day terms every time you submit an application. Moreover, BlueX supports different payment methods, including offline remittance, same-day ACH, and SWIFT. \n\nTo learn more, contact the BlueX sales team at [sales@bluexpay.com](sales@bluexpay.com)",
