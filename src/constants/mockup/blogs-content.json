If the bill stalls, there is [still a risk of default.](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2023/05/how-u-s-debt-limit-drama-has-hurt-economy/) Compounded by factors like inflation, rising interest rates, and slow economic growth, declining business sentiment, and concerns about credit access have been persistent.\n\nAccording to the [WSJ,](https://www.wsj.com/video/series/dion-rabouin/cpi-the-debt-ceiling-and-the-state-of-small-business-what-to-watch/439897C3-B166-4879-BE31-FEDBB376C61D) business sentiment has been consistently declining for the past 15 months, with small business optimism remaining below the 49-year average. Additionally, [a recent survey conducted by Goldman Sachs](https://www.goldmansachs.com/intelligence/pages/more-than-75-percent-of-surveyed-small-businesses-are-worried-about-credit.html) revealed that over 75% of surveyed SMBs are concerned about their access to credit, with rising interest rates and difficulties in securing affordable capital being major obstacles. \n\nIf a default happens, the repercussions include recession, credit crunch, higher inflation, and a weaker dollar, with potential turmoil in the stock and bond markets, posing additional challenges for small businesses. Those with federal contracts would be particularly affected, experiencing disrupted cash flow, while the credit crunch and high-interest rates have already made it harder for SMBs to secure loans, amplifying the economic impact.",

        "content": "To mitigate potential risks and uncertainties, small business owners are advised to take proactive measures. These include maintaining a strong relationship with their banks, closely monitoring their financial numbers, understanding their customer profiles, and diversifying their customer base. Furthermore, it is crucial for SMBs to communicate openly with stakeholders about the potential impact and implement contingency plans to navigate the challenges ahead.\n\n**1. Maintain a Strong Banking Relationship**\nBuilding a solid relationship with your bank is crucial, even before the need for funding arises. Regularly communicate with your bank, keep them updated on your business progress, and establish trust. This proactive approach can increase the likelihood of securing credit when needed and provide a lifeline during economic uncertainties.\n\n**2. Strengthen Financial Management**\nIn times of economic uncertainty, it is essential to have a deep understanding of your business’ financials. Review your numbers regularly and identify areas where you can optimize costs and improve efficiency. This proactive analysis will empower you to make informed decisions and navigate through potential challenges.\n\n**3. Diversify Customer Base**\nOver-reliance on any single customer, particularly the federal government, can expose your business to significant risks. Consider diversifying your customer base to reduce dependence on a single source of revenue. Expanding your customer reach can minimize the impact of potential disruptions caused by a debt ceiling crisis.\n\n**4. Plan for Cash Flow Challenges**\nPrepare for potential disruptions in cash flow by maintaining adequate reserves. Increase your cash reserves and be cautious with expenditures, ensuring that essential business operations can continue even in a challenging economic environment. Communicate your plans and potential delays to stakeholders in advance to manage expectations effectively.\n",

The main cause was a cascade effect of runs on deposits produced by the closing of SVB and Signature Bank. \n- According to the New York Times, the three banks [combined held more in inflation-adjusted assets](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/business/bank-failures-svb-first-republic-signature.html) than the 25 U.S. banks that collapsed in the financial crisis of 2008. \n\n![image1.png](/uploads/image1_278db2c02d.png)\nSource: [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/business/bank-failures-svb-first-republic-signature.html) via data from Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

[Close to 50% of banks surveyed](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/banks-tighten-credit-terms-see-loan-demand-drop-fed-survey-shows-2023-05-08/) said that lending standards were slightly more stringent to small businesses compared to January of this year.\n\n1. <u>Another interest rate rise:</u> In late March, The Federal Reserve [decided to raise rates by 0.25%](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65041649) even while the banking collapse was happening. This has also led to higher interest rates on business financing in the short term. ",

        "content": "**Prioritize a healthy balance sheet over growth:** In these times of economic disruption, focusing on the fundamentals of cash flow management and maintaining a healthy balance sheet should sometimes take precedence over business growth. You can consider pausing plans to grow your business and instead look at how to keep capital stable in the long-term beyond just this month or quarter.  \n\n**Digitize your AR:** Moving your legacy AR processes onto a digital platform at this timing is not just helpful, it’s essential. Such platforms are shown to greatly improve invoice reconciliation, reduce days sales outstanding (DSO), and increase overall visibility and efficiency in the payment process. If you’re not able to see all of your payment data in a single window, maintaining long-term visibility over your capital will become increasingly difficult.   \n\n**Inventory financing or A/R factoring:** There are more and more creative ways to finance your business besides credit cards and bank loans. If you are a retail business that struggles to purchase the stock you need for seasonal demands, you can consider inventory financing, which is using the inventory you need to buy as collateral for itself. Or, businesses with credit histories too short to get loans can try accounts receivable (A/R) factoring, or selling your invoices to a third party company for an advance on a portion of the invoice value. You can contact BlueX Sales for more information about our related solutions. \n\n**Use Pay-it-Later to maintain strong cash flow:** Just by giving you more time to pay, B2B Pay-it-Later (PIL) solutions can help to offset rising supply costs and help your business acquire more inventory. B2B PIL is an ideal solution for companies looking to modernize their payment systems, reduce costs, and improve their competitive advantage.\n\nFor example, [BlueX Pay-it-Later](https://www.bluextrade.com/pay-it-later/) offers pay-later options for your cargo and all your logistics invoices, providing financing options with up to 100% of net invoice value and up to 1 million in funds available in 48 hours. BlueX will pay your vendor on time, and you can choose between net 30/60-day terms every time you submit an application. Moreover, BlueX supports different payment methods, including offline remittance, same-day ACH, and SWIFT. \n\nTo learn more, contact the BlueX sales team at [sales@bluexpay.com](sales@bluexpay.com)",

        "content": "Embedded finance is a rapidly growing trend that is [expected to double in size to $51 billion by 2026.](https://www.bain.com/insights/embedded-finance/) The B2B payments market is anticipated to be the biggest potential market, estimated to reach $33.3 trillion in size by 2026. Companies that want to capitalize on this opportunity should consider incorporating software into their commercial processes to enhance the customer experience and stay competitive. In 2026, the transaction value of embedded finance is expected to surge from $2.6 trillion to $7 trillion.\n\nEmbedded finance promises to improve customer experiences and financial access, and provide cost and risk benefits to companies, which is why the demand for it is expected to continue to grow. This new ecosystem requires four main participants: the end customer, platforms that own the customer relationship, software enablers that help meet complex regulatory and technological requirements, and a regulatory services or license provider. While payments and lending currently dominate the embedded finance landscape, insurance, tax, and accounting are also expected to contribute to growth in the future. Despite the rapid growth of embedded financial services, there hasn't been as much quantitative exploration of the industry's dynamics, and different sectors and services are developing at different rates.\n",

        "content": "The Buy-Now-Pay-Later (BNPL) or Pay-it-Later (PIL) model for businesses is gaining popularity, with B2B PIL looking especially promising. B2B BNPL offers many benefits that can help small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) overcome economic challenges and grow their businesses. Companies can benefit from reduced interest payments and a much simpler method of making purchases. Moreover, B2B PIL allows third-party credit and risk-management tools that speed up credit approval and reduce repayment risk, leading to simplified cash flow management for businesses. According to [the PYMNTS report released in 2023,](https://www.pymnts.com/tracker/buy-now-pay-later-small-business-automation-b2b-supplier-payment/) B2B payments are critical to the modern economy, with a global volume of $120 trillion per year and the industry valued at $103 billion as of 2022. \n\nIn [a Forbes survey on the status quo of small businesses in 2023,](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/small-business-statistics/) it was found that inventory was one of the highest expenses for small businesses, representing an average of 17 to 25% of their spending. While inventory is crucial for generating revenue in the long term, the upfront cost of purchasing inventory can be a significant burden for small businesses with limited working capital, especially during peak seasons when stock needs to be high. SMBs can use BNPL to offset rising supply costs, pay suppliers in installments, and acquire more inventory, simply by getting more time to pay. By easing the burden on payment terms and their accounting teams, BNPL can help companies cut costs and improve cash flow, making it a powerful tool for improving the quality of life for small businesses worldwide. Furthermore, by simplifying the payment process, BNPL can help businesses avoid payment delays, cash management challenges, and other issues that may hinder their competitive standing in the marketplace. Overall, B2B BNPL is an ideal solution for companies looking to modernize their payment systems, reduce costs, and improve their competitive advantage.\n\nThis is where [BlueX](https://www.bluextrade.com/) steps in to help businesses grow.

However, for those more digitally-savvy companies who seek out such solutions, there is an opportunity to close the gap in their own value chains. \n\n![image1.png](/uploads/image1_d33e28cf0c.png)\n\nBelow is a breakdown of what digital practices different players in this new freight ecosystem might adopt:     \n\n- <u>Vendors:</u> Digitization of documents and adoption of digital AR payments. \n- <u>Banks:</u> Integration of open banking APIs and embracing fintechs as partners for evolved SCF services. \n- <u>Fintechs:</u> Acquisition of richer global datasets, adoption of AI-based underwriting, and more consumer-driven, low-touch experiences.\n- <u>Payers:</u> Innovators embracing technology to evolve supply chains to compete and grow.

        "title": "SMEs’ freight fintech needs resemble that of larger enterprises",
        "content": "The fintech needs of SMEs don’t differ greatly from those of large corporations. For example, a small-sized payer based in the US might need to make fast cross-border payments to vendors as well as require net 30/120-day terms. Meanwhile, their Asia-based vendor is focused on getting paid faster and being able to offer terms to their customers. \n\n![image7.png](/uploads/image7_83fcdd6ba3.png)\n\nThe kinds of support that freight fintechs provide to payers and vendors can be broken down into three categories:\n\n- Trade Finance: financing options for international cargo movement.\n- Logistics Finance: financing options for international logistics movement.\n- International Payments: fast and inexpensive international payments with FX.\n\nBelow are some of the core services for SMEs that we are seeing and can expect to see more of from fintechs in the new digital freight ecosystem: \n\n**Pay-it-Later solutions to improve cash flow**\n\nAs discussed above, many SMEs struggle to maintain cash flow amid the recent disruptions to the logistics industry, especially port congestion. Small-sized retailers feel the effects of blocked ports quickly and acutely, with [97% reporting that they had been impacted](https://www.logisticsmgmt.com/article/ocean_shipping_issues_are_in_the_spotlight_in_letters_to_the_white_house) by the major port and shipping delays in 2021 in a National Retail Federation survey. \n\nWhen ports are blocked and containers are unable to be unloaded, SMEs face detention and demurrage charges beyond their capacity to immediately cover. Thankfully, freight fintechs are now offering digital Pay-It-Later solutions to help SMEs release their ocean cargo and maintain cash flow for healthy business operations. \n\n**Blockchain for future value chain transparency** \n\nIn the eyes of the tech industry, blockchain is still an early-stage technology that has yet to prove its merits in sectors such as logistics. That said, many believe that SaaS products based on distributed ledger technologies will play a vital role in the digital transformation of global supply chains, and we are seeing more and more such solutions in the market. \n\nThe benefits that blockchain services offer SMEs in turning their legacy supply chains into robust and agile value chains include: \n\n- The use of stablecoins – or cryptocurrency designed to be relatively stable by being pegged to a commodity or currency – to enable faster and cheaper B2B payments. \n- Blockchain for documentation and identity management, resulting in easier KYC (Know Your Customer) and KYB (Know Your Business) verification along with global underwriting.\n- Adopting DeFi and Smart Contracts to build secured credit pools or DAOs, enabling a lower cost of capital for SMEs. \n\nA number of multinational companies are constructing the required infrastructure to provide these kinds of decentralized logistics services as well as integrate more SMEs into their global supply chains.  \n\nFor example, TradeLens is an open and neutral industry platform underpinned by blockchain technology and supported by major players in the global shipping industries, such as Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd. The platform - which runs on IBM Cloud and IBM Blockchain – has [already helped multiple companies by providing a more timely and consistent view of logistics data](https://newsroom.ibm.com/2021-06-24-Hapag-Lloyd-and-Ocean-Network-Express-Complete-TradeLens-Integration,-Join-Rapidly-Expanding-Shipping-Ecosystem-to-Further-Enhance-Trade-Digitization) for their containerized freight across the globe.\n\nAdditionally, [Walmart Canada has recently pioneered an automated invoicing and payments system](https://hbr.org/2022/01/how-walmart-canada-uses-blockchain-to-solve-supply-chain-challenges) for its 70 third-party freight carriers built on top of distributed ledger technology. The system has already helped the retailer combat vast data discrepancies in the invoice and payment process for the carriers, which before required costly reconciliation efforts and caused long payment delays.\n",

        "content": "Accounts receivable factoring, or A/R factoring, is a form of financing where businesses sell their invoices to a third-party factoring company at a discount. The company then advances a percentage of the invoice value to the business, typically 70% to 90%, and, once the business’ customer pays the invoice, the factoring company pays the business the balance, minus fees. \n\nFor example, a 90% advance rate on a $10,000 invoice would mean the factoring company sends the business $9,000 upfront, then remits the difference when the invoice is collected from the business’ customer at the end of the invoice period, less a handling fee. A/R factoring fees generally fall between 1 and 6 percent of the total invoice. In the above example, if the fee is 3%, then the factoring company would remit $700 to the business once the customer has paid the invoice.\n\nIf you’re concerned about how using A/R factoring might affect your balance sheet, don’t be. The accounts receivable would be listed as a current asset, as it typically can be converted into cash within a year. If the amount converts into cash in a period of more than one year, it is instead recorded as a long term asset. ",

        "content": "There are several common scenarios in which businesses select A/R factoring as a financing option:\n\n- <u>Long or unpredictable collection times:</u> Some industries, such as logistics, have extended payment terms, which can be challenging for small businesses. Factoring can provide immediate cash to keep capital stable between payments.\nSeasonal fluctuations: Businesses that experience fluctuations in revenue throughout the year use A/R factoring to help keep cash flow robust during slow seasons.\n- <u>Short credit histories:</u> Small businesses with limited credit history or poor credit scores use accounts receivable factoring as a way to access financing without their credit history being a concern.\n- <u>Uneven collections and disbursements:</u> Companies such as temporary staffing agencies pay employees on a bi-weekly basis, but their invoices are settled monthly. A/R factoring helps these companies cover their overhead in the interim. \n- <u>Dependency on other parties:</u> In the construction industry, sub-contractors only get paid once the project owner settles their invoice with the lead contractor. A/R factoring can provide immediate payment to sub-contractors, allowing them to meet their expenses and keep capital flowing into their business.\n",

The handling fees are usually lower than non-recourse factoring since the business assumes more risk.\n- <u>Non-Recourse factoring:</u> The factoring company bears the loss if the factored invoice is not settled. Handling fees are usually higher because the factoring company assumes more risk.\n",

Factoring companies, however, base their approval on the credit history of the business’ customers rather than on the business itself. \n- <u>Collateral-free:</u> Bank loans will almost certainly require collateral, whereas factoring companies do not, since the financing is secured by the accounts receivable.\n- <u>Low interest charges:</u> Banks and credit cards generally come with higher interest rates. Factoring companies, meanwhile, charge fees rather than collect interest, with the rate often being based on the business’s credit history. \n- <u>Flexible repayment terms:</u> Compared to banks or credit cards, which typically require fixed monthly payments, factoring companies offer more flexible repayment terms.  \n\n",

        "content": "While some contracts are fixed in stone, customers and suppliers are still human beings who may be flexible and open to discussion with regard to the timing on payments. Here are a few areas you can explore with them:\n\n<u>1) Offer discounts for early payment</u>\n\nHave you considered offering incentives for your clients to pay their invoices earlier? An early payment discount (EPD) can range from 1 to 2%, but a small loss in revenue might be worth getting fast access to cash that can be put towards urgent business needs, such as payroll or rent. Another benefit is that receiving payments early contributes to lower days sales outstanding (DSO) metrics, which can enhance your company’s overall financial health rating.     \n\n<u>2) Negotiating with suppliers on payment due dates</u>\n\nThe payment terms in most industries are generally net 30, which means that payments that are as little as a day late can have a major impact on expenses on a fixed schedule like rent or payroll. However, some supply chain partners may be open to accepting net 15 or net 20 payment terms. \n",

        "content": "There is an undisputed correlation between modernizing AP / AR processes and overall business growth. A [recent PYMNTS report](https://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2022/25-percent-b2b-payments-are-made-by-check/) found that over 50% of US CFOs surveyed say that digitizing their AP / AR operations has allowed for an increase in payment types such as [ACH payments](https://www.bluextrade.com/blog/are-ach-payments-safe-in-2022-advantages-and-disadvantages), credit cards, wires, and real-time payments (RTP), among others. \n\n<u>1) Centralize your payment tools</u>\n\nEfficiency and transparency in AP / AR processes are essential to cash flow management, which is why relying on manual operations can result in wasted resources. All-in-one payment platforms offer a remedy to this scenario by bringing all of these processes – such as expenses, payroll, and revenue management – under one digital dashboard. Over 40% of main street businesses surveyed by [PYMNTS](https://www.pymnts.com/smbs/2023/small-merchants-opt-automation-over-price-hikes-manage-slowing-consumer-demand/) said that implementing an all-in-one payment platform simplified their receivables tracking, and 32% said the technology had led to improvements in working capital.   \n\nBlueX Pay, for example, offers [a payment platform](https://www.bluextrade.com/payer/) that amplifies cash flow for buyers and sellers. Businesses can set up a digital wallet to make and receive payments, as well as access Pay-it-Later services. All of the transactions can be viewed on their dashboard, which enables easy reconciliation. \n\n<u>2) Use digital payments, and encourage your supply chain to do the same</u>\n\nUsing legacy accounting processes such as mailing physical checks may avoid the costs of digital payments, but you should consider the time it takes to process the checks, which can take anywhere from days to weeks. This time loss could translate into a loss in capital which can easily  exceed a digital processing fee. This does not mean that you need to stop using checks for the vendors who prefer this approach, but it would be worthwhile to encourage other businesses in your supply chain to switch to digital payments, as  this could bring benefits to all.  \n\nAnd with the FedNow real-time payment network set to launch in the US later this year, there has never been a more advantageous time for businesses to make the move to digital payments.

        "content": "An uncertain economy and limited access to bank loans are leading small businesses to search for more creative financing methods, such as [inventory financing](https://www.bluextrade.com/blog/Inventory-Financing-the-Pros-and-Cons), invoice factoring, or B2B pay-it-later solutions. Fintech companies are watching the trends and rolling out tools that connect businesses to these finance options, which can provide a lower barrier to entry and more flexible payment terms. \n\n<u>1) Inventory financing</u>\n\nWith inventory financing, businesses can put up the inventory they wish to buy as collateral for the purchase itself, such as in cases where they need additional stock for a busy season. The borrower doesn't need to pay back the lender until after they sell off all the inventory, and if the business defaults on the loan, the lender has the option to then try and sell the remaining stock themselves.  \n\nThe benefits of inventory financing include: no need to stake personal assets such as a house or car; funding is usually fast; and there’s no credit check required. However, this approach usually requires more due diligence on the part of lenders to access the inventory’s liquidation value, which can result in longer wait times for funding. And some lenders may demand a minimum amount of financing that might be too high for smaller businesses to meet. You can consider [BlueX](https://www.bluextrade.com/pay-it-later/) to assist you with inventory financing, as we don't require an assessment on the inventory's liquidation value, nor do we require a minimum amount to get the financing. \n\n<u>2) Invoice Factoring</u> \n\nInvoice factoring, also known as AR factoring, is a finance option in which the business sells its invoices to a third party at a reduced price, which allows the business fast access to working capital without needing to take out a loan. For example, a 90% advance on a $10,000 invoice would provide the business with $9,000 in cash right now, with the difference going to the factoring company upon collection of the invoice from the businesses’ customer. \n\n<u>3) BlueX Pay-it-Later</u>\n\nBlueX offers a third alternative to small businesses that need to enhance their cash flow in the form of our B2B Pay-it-Later solution. BlueX Pay-it-Later offers fast access to up to $1 million for cargo and all your logistics service needs. Businesses can get approved in less than 48 hours, and have up to 60 days to pay back their invoices. There is no application or set up fees, and we pay your vendors on time so you can pay later and focus on the goals that drive business growth.\n\nReach out to the [BlueX team](https://www.bluextrade.com/pay-it-later/) on how to make better payments and amplify your cash flow.\n",

Nearly 40% of businesses surveyed by [PYMNTS](/uploads/PYMNTS_B2_B_And_Digital_Payments_Tracker_November_December_2022_0a2ea359d5.pdf) cited inflation as their biggest challenge in 2022, compared to only 23% at the beginning of that year. Areas where expenses increased included shipping, property taxes, as well as higher costs of hiring employees. According to [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/small-business-statistics/), 57% of US small businesses had to cut costs in response to the above. \n\n\n![fintech stats.png](/uploads/fintech_stats_20b6696b02.png)\n\nSource: [PYMNTS](/uploads/PYMNTS_B2_B_And_Digital_Payments_Tracker_November_December_2022_0a2ea359d5.pdf), [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/small-business-statistics/), [US Labor Department](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/13/worker-shortage-supply-chain-crisis-fuel-2022-top-states-for-business.html)\n\n\n**Labor Shortages**\n\nThe enormous talent gap that the US is currently facing has left key economic policymakers with little hope for change in the coming years. Federal Reserve Chair [Jerome Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/mediacenter/files/FOMCpresconf20221214.pdf) noted at a recent press conference that the US has a “structural labor shortage” that is unlikely to be resolved anytime soon. According to the [US Labor Department](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/13/worker-shortage-supply-chain-crisis-fuel-2022-top-states-for-business.html), there is a gap of 5.5 million in the number of retail job openings in the US compared to the number of workers to fill them. \n\nLess available workers means that businesses must offer increasingly competitive salaries to attract talent, a cost that is much harder to meet under increased inflation and interest rates. The above Forbes report cited labor as the highest cost for small businesses in 2022, representing 70% of spending.\n\n**Inventory costs** \n\nJust behind labor in the [Forbes survey](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/small-business-statistics/) was inventory, which took up an average of 17 to 25% of  small business spending. Inventory should generally translate into revenue in the long run, but the purchasing of inventory can be an extremely high expense for small businesses with limited working capital, especially during peak seasons when stock needs to be high.  \n\n**Limited capital** \n\n[Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/small-business-statistics/) listed running out of capital as the second most common reason that small businesses failed in 2022. With less access to traditional finance tools compared to larger-sized businesses, it is often a struggle for smaller companies to amass the cash they need to cover operating expenses and maintain inventory. \n",

According to [Capterra Research](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221219005042/en/%C2%A088-of-U.S.-Small-Businesses-Will-Continue-Moving-Supply-Chains-Closer-to-Home-in-2023), supply chain professionals in small business ranked inflation (65%), lack of inventory (45%), and a possible economic recession (42%) among their top three concerns going into 2023. We’ve identified several key business trends we expect to see in 2023:\n\n**Small businesses will shorten their supply chains**\n\nTo reduce costs, more and more US small businesses are moving their supply chains closer to home. According to data from the [US Chamber of Commerce](https://www.uschamber.com/small-business/inflation-concern-reaches-new-high-for-small-business-owners), more than half of small businesses surveyed have altered their supply chains to be more reliant on local suppliers. And the [Capterra Research report](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221219005042/en/%C2%A088-of-U.S.-Small-Businesses-Will-Continue-Moving-Supply-Chains-Closer-to-Home-in-2023) shows that 88% of small businesses either plan to or are already switching at least some of their suppliers to companies closer to the US in 2023. \n\n**Cross border payment challenges will continue**\n\nIn line with global supply chain challenges, cross border payment systems have yet to meet the needs of small businesses, and not just those in the US. According to a joint report between [PYMNTS and Payoneer,](https://www.pymnts.com/smbs/2022/75-percent-of-small-businesses-dissatisfied-with-cross-border-payment-solutions/#:~:text=Twenty%2Dseven%20percent%20of%20SMBs,be%20very%20or%20extremely%20satisfactory.) 27% of small businesses worldwide view the complexity of cross-border payments as a drag on their growth. And only 23% of those surveyed were satisfied with their current cross-border payment solutions.  \n\n![fintech stats 2.png](/uploads/fintech_stats_2_e9ba75e9f1.png)\nSource: [Capterra Research](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221219005042/en/%C2%A088-of-U.S.-Small-Businesses-Will-Continue-Moving-Supply-Chains-Closer-to-Home-in-2023), [PYMNTS & Payoneer](https://www.pymnts.com/smbs/2022/75-percent-of-small-businesses-dissatisfied-with-cross-border-payment-solutions/#:~:text=Twenty%2Dseven%20percent%20of%20SMBs,be%20very%20or%20extremely%20satisfactory.) \n\n**More small businesses will look for alternative financing options**\n\nDisruptions to cash flow and a lack of traditional lender support is pushing small businesses to search for alternative and often more creative financing methods, such as [invoice factoring](https://www.bluextrade.com/blog/Inventory-Financing-the-Pros-and-Cons), inventory financing, or Buy-Now-Pay-Later (BNPL) solutions. The advantages of these options usually include a lower barrier to entry along with more flexible payment terms, and fintech companies are innovating in line with demand to provide easier access to these financial tools.

        "title": "How fintech is helping small businesses grow",
        "content": "Fintech platforms have already been bridging the gap between small businesses and traditional financial institutions for several years. But with inflation and interest rate hikes still going strong into 2023, we expect to see an acceleration in this trend across all sectors. \n\nThe benefits of adopting fintech are extensive. Small businesses that incorporate new payment technology platforms and modernize their AP and AR processes are more likely to see growth in their sales, profits, and employment. A total of 93% of US CFOs surveyed by [PYMNTS](https://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2022/25-percent-b2b-payments-are-made-by-check/) said that they are in the process of digitizing their accounting operations. Meanwhile, more than half of the same group said that digitization has allowed them to increase use of payment types such as [ACH payments](https://www.bluextrade.com/blog/are-ach-payments-safe-in-2022-advantages-and-disadvantages), credit cards, wires, and real-time payments (RTP), among others.  Businesses should continue to educate themselves on the various fintech solutions emerging and which areas of their business these tools can strengthen. \n\n**Real time payments to shorten the payment cycle** \n\nDespite the availability of new fintech solutions, numerous industries are still relying on legacy payment methods. According to [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesfinancecouncil/2022/12/13/how-small-business-owners-can-help-cork-cashflow-problems/) data, paper checks remain the most common form of business-to-business (B2B) payments at 81%. The problem with checks is that they need to be physically mailed, which can take an average of 90 days to pay. For small businesses surviving from payment to payment, that could seem like an eternity. \n\nReal time payments are shaking up traditional means of sending money. Simply put, RTP networks allow small businesses and their supply chain partners to get paid in real time. By significantly shortening the payment cycle, small businesses can decrease risk for their business operations. \n  \n \n![fintech stats 3.png](/uploads/fintech_stats_3_1137b80ebd.png)\nSource: [PYMNTS](https://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2022/25-percent-b2b-payments-are-made-by-check/), [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesfinancecouncil/2022/12/13/how-small-business-owners-can-help-cork-cashflow-problems/), [PYMNTS](/uploads/PYMNTS_B2_B_And_Digital_Payments_Tracker_November_December_2022_0a2ea359d5.pdf)\n\n\nThe [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesfinancecouncil/2022/12/13/how-small-business-owners-can-help-cork-cashflow-problems/) report states that most US businesses expect to be able to send and receive business real-time payments in 2023, and almost 50% are interested in using RTP for recurring or ad hoc payments, indicating a long developing demand for their service. The report also highlights how over 250 financial institutions in the US currently meet roughly 61% of demand deposit accounts on the RTP network. \n\nBoth banks and the US government understand the importance among businesses and individuals of processing payments instantly, which is why the Federal Reserve Bank aims to launch its instant payment service, U.S. FedNow, within 2023. The outlook is optimistic for the benefits the service can offer to small businesses.      \n\n**All-in-one payment solutions for more effective cash management** \n\nEconomic uncertainty is prompting an unprecedented need for smart cash management to keep businesses cash flow positive. However, many of these businesses lack the accounting manpower to optimize in this area, which is why many companies are shifting to intelligent digital cash management solutions. One example is all-in-one payment platforms. \n\nAccording to [PYMNTS](/uploads/PYMNTS_B2_B_And_Digital_Payments_Tracker_November_December_2022_0a2ea359d5.pdf), 40% of small businesses surveyed have already shifted to using online all-in-one payment platforms to manage their accounting, with more than 50% claiming the platforms have made cash management easier and 32% already seeing improvements in their cash flow.   \n\nThe benefits of implementing an all-in-one payment platform include: \n- Businesses receive a 360° view of their entire payer / payee network in one online dashboard. \n- Customization tools allow both buyers and payers to choose the payment methods that are best suited to them. \n- All-in-one platforms can enable businesses to purchase inventory via credit cards from vendors that generally don’t accept this form of payment. \n\n![image13.png](/uploads/image13_4f5882f82b.png)\n\n**Data and AI for more transparent, collaborative accounting**\n\nBuyers and vendors will inevitably have their own preferences for making and receiving payments, and a lack of transparency on either side relating to payment status can lead to increased friction. That’s why capturing business intelligence throughout the AR / AP process can be crucial to overcoming these conflicts. \n\nBeyond the visibility into payments statuses that an online platform can provide, integrating data and artificial intelligence (AI) solutions into a dashboard can help predict and prepare for future payment situations, such as which vendors are likely to pay late or when a company may need additional payroll for a busy season. What’s more, sharing this data with external payers or payees can help avoid friction for both sides as well as help prevent missed or delayed payments.\n\n**Cash flow forecasting to stay ahead of upcoming expenses** \n\nNot all operational expenses can be predicted, especially during turbulent economic times such as now. This is another scenario in which small businesses can apply business intelligence to stay prepared and to take proactive measures to ensure stable cash flow. Adding a cash flow forecasting tool to an online dashboard allows accounting to track expenses and receipts to forecast future financial health. \n\nFor example, if you require more inventory during peak seasons, a cash flow forecasting tool can use past years’ business data to give you a stronger picture of how much inventory you’ll need to buy and even identify where you can acquire it for a lower price, helping you avoid overspending. It could also help you make sure you have enough inventory so that you don’t lose any sales. Or, the tool can help you know which bills to put on hold or which invoices to pay to ensure you have enough cash to fund your employees’ payroll. \n\n**Open banking enables lender flexibility & customization**\n\nOpen banking – or the sharing of financial data between banks to third parties by APIs to offer enhanced services – is still in the developmental stage in the US. However, if we look at progress in countries like the UK – the US is likely to follow suit. According to data from software firm [Endava](https://www.endava.com/en/blog/Business/2022/Open-Banking-in-the-US#:~:text=Faster%20adoption%20in%20the%20last,than%20500%25%20in%2012%20months.), open banking is showing strong cumulative growth in the UK, with 4.5 million regular users as of the middle of 2022, 600,000 of which were small businesses.\n\nThe need has never been greater for small businesses to be able to avail themselves of open banking services. One use case is the customization for financing solutions for borrowers: open banking allows a much higher degree of flexibility to lenders, such as repayment options that can be adapted to fit the borrower (small business) as their financial situation changes over time. This is the kind of flexibility small businesses need to navigate and weather tough financial situations. \n\n**BNPL for greater business resilience** \n\nBuy-Now-Pay-Later (BNPL) solutions have seen increasing consumer adoption during the last few years due to uncertain economic conditions, and now more small businesses are taking advantage of fintech solutions providing this service. Inflation and rising interest rates can dig into companies’ cash flows and inventory, making them far more vulnerable to economic disruption.  BNPL allows small businesses to gain fast access to working capital and maintain a healthy cash flow.\n\n![image9.png](/uploads/image9_3a4f39dae3.png)",
