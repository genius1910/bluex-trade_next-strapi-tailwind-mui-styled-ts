Through your Global Account number, you can collect funds via domestic payment methods and/or SWIFT.\n\nGlobal Accounts can be opened in two different jurisdictions – the United States and Hong Kong. Depending on where you expect to receive payments, you can open a Global Account in that jurisdiction, so that you can save on costs and receive funds on a local level. Receive money quickly. Most local payments settle on the same day.",
